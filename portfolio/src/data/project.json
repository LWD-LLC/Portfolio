The idea came from thinking about my experiences on the oil field using JSAs daily to ensure awarness of potential hazards. I noticed that a ton of the booklets that hold the JSAs are lost throughout time and thus cost the company $5-$10 per booklet. I set out to fix this problem by making an app that could send anyone on site the JSA for the day as soon as they get on site. <br /> <br /> The solution that I came up with would utilize a built-in form that could be filled-in, then sent to everyone on the site within a particular radius set by the JSA writer. As soon as the form is submitted it cannot be changed and would be linked to blockchain to verify its authenticity. <br /><br /> Since the form would be sent to the blockchain, it could not be altered and thus protects the employees and the companies alike. An added bonus is that the companies would have an extremely organized database of all the JSAs for every job in the country.</p>"],

By producing an app that makes it easy for individuals to get a caddy to a course near them, we were able to bring a whole new exciting experience to the game that we know and love. <br /><br /> I was brought on the team originally as the Director of Marketing and SEO and a partner. However, I have since been moved to Chief Innovation and Marketing Officer as it fits my role within the company better. By providing simple and innovative solutions to the team, we have been able to modify the app for a better user experience, gain traction, and are only getting started. <br /><br />Starting 2022, we will be advertising a large partner with, and working with infleuncers around the world to build our brand. As CMO/CINO, I came up with unique ideas to partner with infleuncers on youtube and create extremely valuable partnerships with them to broadcast our brand.</p>"],
