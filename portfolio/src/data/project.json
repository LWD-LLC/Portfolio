The fullstack build started with setting up the frontend (Top image) build in react by hardcoding movies, components, etc. into the frontend to get the design right. Once the design was right, I moved on to the Login and Register Page. Feel free to register and log in so that you can see the full site (Image 1).<br /><br />From the frontend, I created the server-side logic and API, which includes routes, models, and user auth. The user registration and auth was the easy part. This challenge got more difficult once I started to add the admin rights. <br /><br />Admin is ran by Crypto-js AES 256 bit encryption. This allows only the admins who have admin privledges to do CRUD operations on the database and storage (Image 2).<br /><br />Once the admin pages was set, I added some movies to the Database from the admin panel and dynamically imported them via the api into the frontend (Image 3).</p>"],

The idea came from thinking about my experiences on the oil field using JSAs daily to ensure awarness of potential hazards. I noticed that a ton of the booklets that hold the JSAs are lost throughout time and thus cost the company $5-$10 per booklet. I set out to fix this problem by making an app that could send anyone on site the JSA for the day as soon as they get on site. <br /> <br /> The solution that I came up with would utilize a built-in form that could be filled-in, then sent to everyone on the site within a particular radius set by the JSA writer. As soon as the form is submitted it cannot be changed and would be linked to blockchain to verify its authenticity. <br /><br /> Since the form would be sent to the blockchain, it could not be altered and thus protects the employees and the companies alike. An added bonus is that the companies would have an extremely organized database of all the JSAs for every job in the country.<br /><br /> The project was created with Next.js, Pusher, GoogleMaps API, and React. In the future it will feature a backend for CRUD and database so that the forms can be saved and read by certified personnel. </p>"],
